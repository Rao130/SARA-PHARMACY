# ðŸš€ Railway Deployment Guide for Sara Pharmacy

## Prerequisites

1. **Railway Account**: Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **Git Repository**: Push your code to GitHub/GitLab
3. **MongoDB Atlas**: Set up a cloud MongoDB database
4. **Railway CLI** (optional but recommended)

## Step 1: Install Railway CLI

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Or using Homebrew on macOS/Linux
brew install railway
```

## Step 2: Login to Railway

```bash
railway login
```

## Step 3: Deploy Backend to Railway

### Option A: Using Railway CLI (Recommended)

1. **Navigate to your project directory:**
```bash
cd c:\Users\Shweat Yadav\Desktop\sara-pharmacy
```

2. **Initialize Railway project:**
```bash
railway init
```

3. **Deploy the application:**
```bash
railway up
```

### Option B: Using Railway Dashboard

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Connect your GitHub account
4. Select your Sara Pharmacy repository
5. Railway will automatically detect your Node.js project

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Set these environment variables in Railway Dashboard:

### Required Variables:
```
NODE_ENV=production
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/sara-pharmacy
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-minimum-32-characters
PORT=5001
```

### Optional Variables:
```
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_KEY\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=firebase-adminsdk@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

### Using Railway CLI to set variables:
```bash
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
railway variables set MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/sara-pharmacy"
railway variables set JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key-minimum-32-characters"
railway variables set PORT=5001
```

## Step 5: Deploy Frontend (Optional - Separate Service)

For frontend deployment, you can use:
- **Vercel** (Recommended for React apps)
- **Netlify**
- **Railway** (as a separate service)

### Using Vercel for Frontend:

1. Install Vercel CLI:
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

2. Deploy frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
vercel
```

3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-domain.railway.app/api/v1
VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://your-backend-domain.railway.app
```

## Step 6: Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In Railway Dashboard â†’ Your Service â†’ Settings â†’ Domains
2. Add your custom domain
3. Update DNS records as instructed
4. Update CORS settings in your backend

## Step 7: Monitor Deployment

1. **Check deployment logs:**
```bash
railway logs
```

2. **Check service status:**
```bash
railway status
```

3. **View service URL:**
```bash
railway domain
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Build Failures
- **Issue**: Node.js version mismatch
- **Solution**: Add `.nvmrc` file with your Node version:
```
18.17.0
```

### 2. Database Connection Issues
- **Issue**: MongoDB connection timeout
- **Solution**: 
  - Check MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist (allow 0.0.0.0/0 for Railway)
  - Verify connection string format
  - Check network access settings

### 3. Environment Variables Not Loading
- **Issue**: Variables not accessible in code
- **Solution**: 
  - Use Railway Dashboard to set variables
  - Restart the service after setting variables
  - Check variable names for typos

### 4. CORS Issues
- **Issue**: Frontend can't connect to backend
- **Solution**: Update CORS origins in server.js:
```javascript
origin: [
  'https://your-frontend-domain.vercel.app',
  'https://your-custom-domain.com'
]
```

## Production Checklist

- [ ] MongoDB Atlas database created and configured
- [ ] Environment variables set in Railway
- [ ] CORS origins updated for production domains
- [ ] JWT secret is strong and secure
- [ ] Firebase credentials configured (if using notifications)
- [ ] Frontend deployed and pointing to correct backend URL
- [ ] Custom domains configured (if needed)
- [ ] SSL certificates active
- [ ] Application tested in production environment

## Useful Railway Commands

```bash
# View service information
railway status

# View deployment logs
railway logs

# Open service in browser
railway open

# Connect to database (if using Railway PostgreSQL)
railway connect

# Restart service
railway redeploy

# View all projects
railway list

# Switch between projects
railway link
```

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Railway documentation: [docs.railway.app](https://docs.railway.app)
2. Check deployment logs for error details
3. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
4. Test locally with production environment variables

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:
1. Set up monitoring and alerts
2. Configure automated backups for MongoDB
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automatic deployments
4. Configure performance monitoring
5. Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
